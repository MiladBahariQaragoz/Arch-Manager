# Arch Daily Plan Startup Task — Design

**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Status:** Approved

## Purpose

On every KDE Plasma login, read the user's `plan.md`, send it to the Groq
chat API, and show a short, actionable daily plan (top priorities + warnings)
in an unmissable popup. If the network is unavailable, fall back to showing
the raw plan so the user always sees something.

## User-Facing Behaviour

1. User logs into KDE Plasma.
2. A `kdialog` popup appears, centered, and must be dismissed.
3. The popup contains: **top 3 priorities for today + any warnings**, derived
   from `plan.md` by Groq.
4. If offline after retries, or the API fails, the popup instead shows the raw
   `plan.md` contents prefixed with an "⚠️ Offline — showing raw plan" header.
5. If `plan.md` is empty, the popup says the plan is empty.

## Architecture

```
KDE login
   │
   ▼
~/.config/autostart/daily-plan.desktop   (XDG autostart entry)
   │  exec
   ▼
daily-plan.sh
   ├─ load GROQ_API_KEY from groq.env
   ├─ read /home/sudo/GoogleDrive/plan.md
   ├─ if empty → kdialog "plan empty" → exit
   ├─ wait for network (retry ~6× / 60s)
   │     └─ still offline → kdialog raw plan (offline header) → exit
   ├─ POST plan + instruction → Groq chat completions
   │     └─ curl/jq error or non-200 → kdialog raw plan (offline header) → exit
   └─ kdialog show Groq result
```

## Components

All live under `~/Documents/Arch Manager/` unless noted.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `daily-plan.sh` | Main logic. Bash + `curl` + `jq`. Executable. |
| `groq.env` | `GROQ_API_KEY=...`, `chmod 600`. Sourced by the script. Never committed. |
| `daily-plan.desktop` | XDG autostart entry; copied to `~/.config/autostart/`. |
| `README.md` | Install, test, and rotate-key instructions. |

## Key Logic Details

### Config
- `PLAN_FILE="/home/sudo/GoogleDrive/plan.md"`
- `GROQ_MODEL="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"`
- `GROQ_URL="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions"`
- API key read from `groq.env` (same dir as script).

### Network wait
- Loop up to 6 times, 10s apart, testing connectivity (e.g.
  `curl -sf --max-time 5 https://api.groq.com` or ping a reliable host).
- Break early once reachable.

### Groq request
- System prompt: instruct the model to act as a focused daily planner.
- User content: the contents of `plan.md`.
- Instruction (style A): "Read the plan below. Output the top 3 priorities to
  achieve today as a short numbered list, followed by a short 'Warnings:'
  section noting anything to be careful about or avoid. Be concise — this is a
  startup popup. If the plan implies deadlines or risks, surface them."
- Parse response with `jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'`.
- Build JSON payload safely with `jq` (not string interpolation) to avoid
  breaking on quotes/newlines in `plan.md`.

### Output
- Use `kdialog --title "Daily Plan" --msgbox "<text>"` for normal output.
- For long content, prefer `kdialog --textbox` via a temp file so it scrolls.
- Decision: detect length / default to `--msgbox`; switch to a temp-file
  `--textbox` if output exceeds a threshold (e.g. > 1500 chars).

### Failure / fallback
- Any of: empty key, network unreachable after retries, curl non-zero,
  HTTP non-200, empty/`null` model content → show raw `plan.md` with the
  offline header.

## Dependencies

- `kdialog` — install via `sudo pacman -S kdialog` (missing on this system).
- `curl`, `jq` — already present.

## Security

- API key stored only in `groq.env` with `chmod 600`; not in the script,
  not in the `.desktop` file, not committed to git.
- **Action item:** the key was shared in plain chat and must be rotated at
  console.groq.com.

## Testing

- Run `daily-plan.sh` manually from a terminal (normal path).
- Simulate offline: temporarily point `GROQ_URL` to an unreachable host or
  disable network → verify raw-plan fallback.
- Empty plan: verify the "plan empty" popup.
- Long plan: verify `--textbox` scroll path.

## Update — Multi-source aggregation (2026-06-28)

`plan.md` is no longer hand-edited. It is generated each run from three source
files by a new `aggregate.py` (Python stdlib, no deps), which runs first in
`daily-plan.sh`, before the network/Groq step.

### Source files (in `/home/sudo/GoogleDrive/`)
- `study.md` — `## Tasks` (`- [ ]`, optional `| due:`) and `## Exams`
  (`- Name | date: YYYY-MM-DD | progress: N%`).
- `work.md` — `## Tasks` with `| due:`.
- `others.md` — `## Recurring` (`| freq:`) and `## Tasks`.

### aggregate.py behaviour
1. Parses the three files; skips lines inside `<!-- -->` comment blocks.
2. **Archives** completed items to `done.md` (tagged with today's date) and
   removes them from their source file:
   - tasks marked `- [x]`;
   - exams whose `date` is in the past.
   Recurring items are never archived.
3. Computes urgency using today's date: overdue tasks, days-until, and
   **at-risk** exams (≤7 days away and <70% progress).
4. Writes `plan.md`: a `⚠️ Needs attention` section (overdue + at-risk),
   then Tasks (soonest due first), Exams, Recurring.

### Generated files (never hand-edited)
- `plan.md` — overwritten each run.
- `done.md` — append-only archive.

### Design notes
- Aggregation is deterministic and offline-safe; it runs regardless of network
  so the fallback popup still shows a fresh `plan.md`.
- Failures in `aggregate.py` must not abort the script (`|| true`).

## Update — Planner folder + SS26 exam sync (2026-06-28)

### Folder move
All planner-managed markdown now lives in `/home/sudo/GoogleDrive/Planner/`
(`study.md`, `work.md`, `others.md`, `plan.md`, `done.md`). Paths updated in
`aggregate.py` (`DRIVE`) and `daily-plan.sh` (`PLAN_FILE`). The SS26 course
files stay in `/home/sudo/GoogleDrive/SS26/`.

### sync_study.py (new, runs before aggregate.py)
Regenerates only the `## Exams` section of `study.md` from two read-only SS26
files; the `## Tasks` section is preserved.

- `SS26/Exams.md` — `- **Name**: Month DD` (no year → assumed 2026). TBA /
  undated entries skipped.
- `SS26/course-progress-report.md` — markdown table; completion % per course.
- **Name matching:** normalise (drop parenthetical text, lowercase, keep
  `[a-z0-9]`), then exact / substring / `difflib` ratio ≥ 0.85. Unmatched →
  `progress: 0%`.
- Output lines: `- Name | date: YYYY-MM-DD | progress: N%`, sorted by date,
  preceded by an auto-generated warning comment.

### Idempotency
- `plan.md` is fully regenerated each run (no accumulation).
- Past exams are archived to `done.md` by `aggregate.py`; because `sync_study.py`
  re-adds them from SS26 on the next run, `append_done()` dedups on the
  `[cat] title` suffix so each item is archived only once.

### Pipeline
`daily-plan.sh`: `sync_study.py` → `aggregate.py` → network/Groq → popup. Both
Python steps are offline-safe and guarded with `|| true`.

## Out of Scope (YAGNI)

- Scheduling more than once per login (no cron/timer).
- Editing or writing back to `plan.md`.
- Multiple LLM providers / model fallback.
- Logging/history of past daily plans.
